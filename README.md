<div class="about-the-project">
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 25px">Are you a tried and true Penn State Fan? Currently, studying at Penn State and want to rock those colors while developing new applications? Look no further, ladies and gents; I have supplied a Penn State Visual Studio Code Theme!<strong>#WEARE! (image below is currently a placeholder)</strong></p>
    <img src="images/opengraph-home.png">
    <p style="font-size: 25px">This color scheme is based on Penn State, their color scheme, and even pulling some hints of Nittany Himself! :bear: So, as a current student, why not show some pride!
    </p>

<div class="Why?"> 
    <h1 style="font-size: 40px"><strong>But why?</strong></h1>
    <p id="bugs" style="font-size: 15px">I grew up in a harrowing home situation, and college seemed unreachable. I initially landed at the University of Maryland Global Campus. Even though my experience is different from most, I wanted to transfer to a school where I could take pride in being. However, the University of Maryland Global Campus allowed me to raise my grades, take enough credits, and foster my admission at Penn State. Without the University of Maryland Global Campus, I would not have the opportunity to become a Penn Stater! I take pride in where I currently study, Software Engineering, so I wanted to take that pride and transform it into my daily life as a developer. <br/> <br/></p>

<div class="Installation"> 
    <h1 id="installation" style="font-size: 40px"><strong>Installation</strong></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 15px">Currently at the moment I do not have a direct way to install this theme, I am still currently working out some kinks in the colors, code, etc. However, once it does release I will put a way to install it here! :coffee:
